## Content Overview

### JavaScript and Java

Learn about the similarities and differences between JavaScript and Java. Understand how JavaScript's dynamic typing and prototype-based object model set it apart from the statically typed Java language.

### Hello World

Start your JavaScript journey by writing your first "Hello World" code. Get a taste of JavaScript's syntax and learn how to display output in a web browser.

### Variables

Explore the concept of variables in JavaScript. Understand how to declare variables, their naming conventions, and the differences between local and global scope.

### Declaring Variables

Dive deeper into declaring variables. Learn about the `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords, and discover how they affect variable scope and mutability.

### Variable Scope

Understand the scope of variables in JavaScript. Learn about global and local variable scope, as well as the impact of block-scoped variables introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
